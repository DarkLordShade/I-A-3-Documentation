Though the base of I&A 3 is created by me (Rarek), there are many others who have kindly dedicated their time to aiding with mission development, be it in the form of contributing their own ideas, submitting mission content or just letting me whittle at them.

Invade & Annex has received such a fantastic response and we constantly receive forum messages, emails and private messages from people letting us know their appreciation of the mission and ideas for it. I will try to credit all those I can think of immediately, but please let me know if I have missed you out!
