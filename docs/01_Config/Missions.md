## Purpose

Missions in I&A 3, by default, cover Tactical Missions, Ghost Missions, Priority Targets and Sub-Objectives, though an endless amount of types can be created by developers. While [Main AOs](/Main_AOs/Overview) and [Bases](/Bases/Overview) cover large-scale, destruction-based attacking and defending, missions are designed to give players an opportunity to approach targets more tactically. These missions should be, essentially, mini missions within I&A 3, randomly spawning throughout the map and using the terrain and objects surrounding them to produce a dynamic set of unique objectives that challenges players and makes them think through their play a lot more than they would in other, larger attacks.
